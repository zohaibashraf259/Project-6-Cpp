# Project-6-Cpp
# 📝 User Registration Form

A beginner-level C++ program that simulates a simple **user registration form**, collecting the user's full name, email, username, and password — with a password confirmation check.

Great for practicing **string input**, `getline()`, and **basic validation logic** in C++!
